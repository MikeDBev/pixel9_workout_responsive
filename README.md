# Pixel 9 Workout Tracker

Static site ready for GitHub Pages.

## How to publish

1. **Create a new repo** (e.g. `pixel9-workout`).
2. Upload *all* files in this folder to the root of the repo.
3. Open **Settings ▸ Pages** and choose:
   * **Source**: `main` (or your default branch)
   * **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. Save → GitHub builds and gives you a URL:<br>
   `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

Open that link on your phone → Chrome ⋮ menu ▸ **Add to Home screen**.

Progress is stored in `localStorage`, so each device keeps its own checklist.
